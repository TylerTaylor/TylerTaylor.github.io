I've always been the curious one in the bunch. Why does this do that? *What if that did this*? I started making websites out of necessity when I was a teenager. I had no idea what I was doing, but the end result was "cool." Fast forward a few years, and my curiousity has piqued. 

I went from copy and pasting to really wanting to know what's going on behind the scenes. Once things started to 'click' I realized there's no going back. **Programming has not only changed the way I look at computers, but it has changed the way I look at life.** Everything is just composed of many, many smaller things, most of which we cannot see. Put them all together and you've got something beautiful.

Programming has always been associated with intelligence. I always thought that it was out of my reach. I thought I could never be as good as them. 

I'm not there *yet*, but I have definitely realized that I was **wrong** to think it's impossible. Every single day I am learning something I didn't know before, and solidifying that knowledge through practice. Each time a problem arises, I have to know the right questions to ask.

Once the knowledge of application is there, the next step is to let the ideas flow. No more "I wish there was an app for this."
No more "Someone should do that."

Anything is possible.
